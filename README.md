# Green Guardian App ðŸŒ¿

Green Guardian App is a web application designed for you to take care of your plants. Get information on each plant through our API, add your plants to your Favorite Plants and set reminders to water them!

Through our SQL database, operated through Sequelize, our app allows users to see diffent plants' name, scientific name, climate, sunlight and watering needs. 
Add a personal name for each of your plants as well as the last day you watered them, and our app will tell you when to water them again according to their needs!

This project was created for The Bridge's Fullstack Web Development course as a final project using the different technologies we've learned **during the span of a week**, by [Julia Isasti](https://github.com/juliaisasti).
